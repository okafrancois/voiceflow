# Completed Execution Plans

Completed plans are archived here after execution finishes and verification evidence is recorded.

## Entry Criteria

A plan belongs in this directory only when all of the following are true:

1. The implementation units are complete
2. Verification evidence is captured in the plan
3. The plan frontmatter status is `completed`
4. The file has been moved from `../active/` to this directory

## Completed Plans

- [Complete Local Whisper Transcription for Long Recordings](./2026-08-23-002-fix-long-whisper-transcription-plan.md) - fix - 2026-08-23
- [Audio Command Boundary Refactor](./2026-04-13-003-refactor-audio-command-boundaries-plan.md) - refactor - 2026-04-13
- [Startup Permission Logging Architecture](./2026-04-14-006-startup-permission-logging-architecture-plan.md) - fix - 2026-04-14

## Maintenance

- When a plan is completed, move it from `../active/` to this directory
- Update `context/plans/README.md` so the active/completed indexes stay accurate
- Update `context/README.md` if archive navigation changes
- Keep filenames unchanged when moving plans so references remain stable
