## Volcengine Streaming

### Description
Real-time streaming STT via WebSocket. Provides partial results during speech, ideal for live dictation scenarios.

### Purpose
- Real-time voice input
- Live transcription with immediate feedback
- Continuous speech recognition

### API Endpoint
```
wss://openspeech.bytedance.com/api/v3/sauc/bigmodel_nostream
```

### Configuration Required
- **App ID**: Application identifier from Volcengine Console
- **Access Token**: Authentication token (may expire, needs refresh)
- **Resource ID** (optional): Default `volc.bigasr.sauc.duration`

### Official Documentation
- [Volcengine Speech-to-Text Console](https://console.volcengine.com/sami)
- [API Documentation](https://www.volcengine.com/context/6561/79817)
- [Streaming Protocol](https://www.volcengine.com/context/6561/79818)

### Key Features
- Partial results during speech
- Language auto-detection
- Punctuation and formatting
- Low latency (~200ms chunk processing)

### STT Output Principle: Raw & Accurate

> **STT should output raw, unprocessed transcription.** The Polish engine handles formatting (ITN, punctuation, deduplication). STT's job is accurate phonetic transcription, not polished text.

**Volcengine configuration:**
```json
{
  "enable_itn": true,     // Spoken digits → "1978" — Polish engine handles formatting
  "enable_punc": true,   // Sentence punctuation — Polish engine handles formatting
  "enable_ddc": false    // Disfluency/deduplication — OFF: preserve raw output
}
```
