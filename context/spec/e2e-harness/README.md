# E2E Testing & Harness Engineering Specification

## Overview

This directory contains the complete design specification for E2E testing and Harness Engineering for Voice Flow (Tauri application).

## Problem Statement

When AI agents modify code, they need to verify:
- Did frontend interactions correctly trigger backend logic?
- Did backend respond correctly to frontend calls?
- Is the IPC contract maintained?
- Are state transitions correct?
- Are events emitted in correct sequence?

Traditional testing gives "pass/fail" but no structured evidence. **Agents need explainable verification**.

## Key Concepts

### Harness Engineering

Structured approach to creating test frameworks that:
1. **Agents can execute autonomously**
2. **Produce structured, interpretable results** (JSON)
3. **Verify multi-layer interactions** (frontend → backend → frontend)
4. **Provide evidence for assertions** (screenshots, state snapshots, event logs)

### Multi-Layer Harness

| Layer | Purpose | Platform |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Contract Harness | Backend-only verification | All (Rust) |
| Mock Harness | Frontend-only verification | All (TypeScript) |
| E2E Playwright MCP | Full stack verification | macOS |
| WebDriver Harness | Full stack verification | Linux/Windows |

### Agent Verification Protocol

```
1. FRAME: Define what needs verification
2. SELECT: Choose appropriate harness type
3. EXECUTE: Run harness with structured output
4. INTERPRET: Parse VerificationResult JSON
5. DECIDE: Based on evidence, what next?
6. REPORT: Document findings
```

## VerificationResult Schema

```typescript
interface VerificationResult {
  verificationId: string;
  passed: boolean;
  confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  
  evidence: {
    ipcCalls: IpcTrace[];
    eventsEmitted: EventTrace[];
    stateTransitions: StateTransition[];
    screenshots?: string[];
  };
  
  conclusions: {
    frontend_triggered_backend: Conclusion;
    backend_responded_correctly: Conclusion;
    state_transition_correct: Conclusion;
    events_correct: Conclusion;
    ui_updated_correctly: Conclusion;
  };
  
  reasoning: string;
  
  agentSummary: {
    shouldProceed: boolean;
    issues: string[];
    recommendations: string[];
  };
}
```

## Quick Start

### Contract Harness (Backend)

```bash
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri
cargo test --test ipc_contract_test -- --format json
```

### Full Verification

```bash
pnpm run verify --request '{"expectedBehavior": {"backendCommand": "start_recording"}}'
```

## Snapshot Principles

- Use real raw screenshots from the running app. Do not use masks, cropping, or image post-processing to force snapshot stability.
- Wait for UI stabilization before every snapshot. The minimum wait is 1000ms, and longer waits are required when transitions or async UI are still settling.
- Keep visual assertions paired with behavioral assertions. A snapshot does not replace explicit checks for route state, labels, enabled/disabled actions, or backend-driven state changes.
- Prefer stable UI states over tolerance inflation. If content is naturally time-varying or data-varying, move the snapshot point to a stable state instead of widening thresholds to hide drift.
- Do not wipe the full snapshot directory during update runs. `e2e:update` should only refresh snapshots touched by the current run, followed by explicit cleanup for stale renamed artifacts.

## Readiness Principles

- For onboarding and other async UI, use explicit readiness assertions instead of guessed waits.
- Permission steps should wait for resolved status signals such as granted icons or non-`pending` permission status attributes.
- Model-download steps should wait for ready UI signals such as a visible ready icon or enabled primary action, not a fixed delay.
- Fixed waits are reserved for pre-snapshot stabilization after the business state is already ready.

## Model Cache Preservation

- Normal E2E setup must not delete previously downloaded model files.
- Keep model directories outside cleanup lists so repeated local runs can reuse existing downloads and stay fast.

## Desktop E2E Defaults

- The default desktop E2E entrypoint is the ordered Tauri runner: `pnpm --filter @voiceflow/desktop run test:e2e`.
- The first ordered spec is a black-box first-run journey that walks the visible user flow from onboarding into the main application.
- Shared runtime is still the default for suite speed, but the runner must clear app-specific WebKit persistence between runs so first-run semantics stay deterministic on macOS.
- Browser-only mock IPC flows are retired from the desktop E2E path. If a test needs mocked frontend-only behavior, it belongs in a lower-layer harness, not in `apps/desktop/tests/e2e`.
