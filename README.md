  <h3>Voice-driven writing, input, and cross-app work for your desktop.</h3>

  <p>
    AriaType is the voice layer for your desktop, turning spoken thoughts into context-aware work right where your cursor is.

## Starting With Writing

When a thought is ready, you should be able to speak it into the work in front of you.

AriaType starts with the writing you do all day: replies, notes, prompts, rough ideas, and text that needs to land in the app you are already using.

It does not only listen to what you said. It also cares where you are writing, where the text should land, and how people actually speak.

## Highlights

- 🔊 **Noise reduction**<br/>
  Filter everyday background noise for more stable voice input.
- 🤫 **VAD voice activity detection**<br/>
  Detect speech, pauses, and silence with less manual control.
- 🧠 **Context awareness**<br/>
  Use the current window to better match the app, field, and task.
- ✍️ **Local and cloud AI polish**<br/>
  Remove fillers, fix punctuation, tighten wording, and choose between local models or your own cloud provider.
- 🧩 **Polish templates**<br/>
  Use built-in or custom templates for chat replies, formal writing, concise notes, documents, and agent prompts.
- 📚 **Word Correction Memory**<br/>
  Best-effort learning captures stable word and phrase replacements from your edits, then reuses repeated corrections locally before polish.
- 🗂️ **Dictionary management**<br/>
  Review learned terms, add custom hotwords, import CSV or alias mappings, and delete individual dictionary items when they are no longer useful.
- 🔤 **Conservative sound-aware hotwords**<br/>
  Match explicit dictionary terms, pinyin, and aliases for product names, tools, and domain terms before AI polish runs.
- ⌨️ **Shortcut workflows**<br/>
  Bind shortcuts to dictation, chat, or custom actions with hold, toggle, and double-tap trigger modes.
- ☁️ **Cloud STT and custom providers**<br/>
  Stay local-first, or connect your preferred speech and language providers with model, language, and endpoint checks.
- 🧭 **Local model management**<br/>
  Download, cancel, delete, and compare local models with size, speed, accuracy, GPU, runtime readiness, and idle unload controls.
- ⚡ **Streaming polish option**<br/>
  Advanced users can stream polish chunks directly into the target app for faster visible output.
- 🧹 **Cleaner final text**<br/>
  Output removes the final Chinese or English sentence period by default while preserving questions, exclamations, and other punctuation.
- 📊 **History and retry**<br/>
  Keep transcription history with raw/final text, engine details, timing, usage trends, and retry support for saved recordings.
- 🌏 **Multilingual**<br/>
  Support Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and more for daily writing.
- 🎯 **Cursor insertion**<br/>
  No window switching or copy-paste; text lands where you are working.
- 🔒 **Privacy and security**<br/>
  Local-first by default, so everyday voice content stays on your device.
- 🖥️ **Desktop comfort**<br/>
  Soft start/end sounds, Light/Dark themes, hidden scrollbars, tray controls, and an adjustable Pill Window.

## Use It For

- **Reply faster** in chat apps, email, collaboration tools, and browser fields.
- **Capture ideas** before they disappear, without stopping to type.
- **Draft prompts and instructions** from natural spoken language.
- **Clean up rough speech** by removing fillers, fixing punctuation, and tightening wording.
- **Write across apps** with one consistent voice workflow.
- **Use the current window as context** when the output should fit the task in front of you.
- **Stay private by default** with local processing for everyday work.

## Why It Feels Different

AriaType is built for your desktop, not just a single input box.

- **Works in the current app**: text lands at the cursor instead of forcing you into another tool.
- **Matches natural speech**: pauses, silence, and everyday noise are part of the experience.
- **Fits the task in front of you**: current-window context helps the output match the app, field, and moment.
- **Lets you choose privacy and power**: use local-first defaults or connect your own services.
- **Feels complete on desktop**: themes, multilingual UI, shortcuts, and a customizable Pill Window.

## Designed Around Your Desktop

AriaType is a voice layer for the desktop, not another place you have to move your work into.

It is built around the current app, the current field, and the current cursor. Wherever you are working, that is where your voice becomes usable text.

## How It Works

1. Install AriaType.
2. Grant microphone and accessibility permissions.
3. Hold the shortcut in any app.
4. Speak naturally.
5. Release and the text appears at the cursor.

By default, `Cmd + /` starts raw dictation, and `Opt + /` inserts polished output. You can change the shortcuts in settings.

## Privacy And Permissions

AriaType asks for only the permissions needed to make desktop voice interaction work:

- 🎙️ **Microphone**: Records your speech.
- ⌨️ **Accessibility**: Inserts text into the active app.
- 🪟 **Screen/window context**: Optional, used for context awareness so output can better match the current app, field, and task.

AriaType does not require an account and does not upload your voice by default. Remote services are optional and are used only when you configure and enable them.
