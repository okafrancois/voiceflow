# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of Voice Flow, a Tauri v2 desktop voice keyboard application.

## When to Read This

- Read [`../README.md`](../README.md) for document routing and canonical sources
- Read [`decisions/README.md`](./decisions/README.md) for why major architectural choices were made
- Read [`data-flow.md`](./data-flow.md) for workflow contracts, state transitions, and IPC boundaries
- Read this document for the system map, domain decomposition, and package boundaries

## Domain Map

| Domain | Packages | Responsibility |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Audio Pipeline** | `audio/recorder.rs`, `audio/resampler.rs`, `audio/processor.rs`, `audio/stream_processor.rs`, `audio/beep.rs`, `audio/level_meter.rs` | Capture, process, and manage audio data |
| **STT Engine** | `stt_engine/sherpa_onnx/`, `stt_engine/cloud/`, `stt_engine/models.rs`, `stt_engine/traits.rs`, `stt_engine/unified_manager.rs` | Convert speech to text using local (sherpa-onnx) or cloud models |
| **Polish Engine** | `polish_engine/lfm.rs`, `polish_engine/qwen.rs`, `polish_engine/anthropic.rs`, `polish_engine/openai.rs` | Refine transcribed text for accuracy and formatting |
| **Text Injection** | `text_injector/macos.rs`, `text_injector/windows.rs` | Insert text at current focus, or into a captured macOS Accessibility target |
| **Ghost** | `ghost/action/`, `ghost/language/` | Unified Ghost concept: Action (macOS computer-use via MCP), Language (habit learning for personalization) |
| **Settings** | `commands/settings/`, `state/unified_state.rs` | Persist and manage user preferences and hotkeys |
| **History** | `history/` | Store and retrieve transcription sessions |
| **UI** | `src/main.tsx`, `src/pill.tsx`, `src/toast.tsx`, `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` | Multi-window interface and notifications |
| **Infrastructure** | `events/`, `utils/`, `tray.rs`, `lib.rs` | Logging, state management, system integration, CI/CD |

## Package Layering

```
packages/shared/          # Zero runtime dependencies, types/constants only
       ↑
apps/desktop/src/         # React 19 frontend (TypeScript strict mode)
       ↑
apps/desktop/src-tauri/  # Rust backend (clippy + fmt enforced)
```

Cross-cutting concerns (auth, telemetry, i18n, feature flags) enter through a single explicit interface per domain.

## Key Files Reference

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `lib.rs` | All Tauri commands must be registered here |
| `state/unified_state.rs` | Single source of runtime truth |
| `stt_engine/traits.rs` | Unified SttEngine trait definition (send_chunk + finish) |
| `stt_engine/unified_manager.rs` | Engine lifecycle management |
| `polish_engine/unified_manager.rs` | Polish engine lifecycle |
| `text_injector/macos.rs` | macOS text injection (keyboard, clipboard, and captured Accessibility target) |
| `src/lib/tauri.ts` | Frontend IPC boundary, all invoke calls go through here |

- [Data Flow](data-flow.md) — Primary workflow, state machine, IPC communication

## Boundaries

| Boundary | Rule |
|----------|------|
| `src-tauri/capabilities/` | Never modify without explicit request |
| `lib.rs` | Commands registered here, not just in modules |
| `src/lib/tauri.ts` | All IPC calls through this file |
| `packages/shared/` | Zero runtime dependencies |
